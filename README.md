Creating cellular automota, such as Langton's Ant & Conway's Game of Live involves considerable code duplication and overlap.
As does plotting interesting mathematical objects such as the Mandelbrot set.

This project serves to provide a unifying framework so that similar simulations/objects can be quickly developed and scaled in future
without having to do all the leg work again.
